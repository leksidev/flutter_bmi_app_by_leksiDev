# Calculator app for calculating body mass index

The body weight calculator was developed as part of Angela Yu's course on the development of mobile applications on Flutter.

## What I have done:
- Designed the screen interface based on an example from a course teacher.
- Implemented the interface.
- Created my own widgets based on native ones.
- I made the first version of business logic: the calculator calculates the body mass index according to a generalized formula, without taking into account gender and age.

## What I will do:
- Upgrade logic.
- Optimize the interface.
